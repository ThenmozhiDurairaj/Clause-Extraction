  to give a brief background, chemical investigations of neem were undertaken by indian pharmaceutical chemists in 1919, whereby they isolated acidic principle in neem oil, which they named as �margosic acid�.
 abamectin, as with other insecticides works to stimulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) system, a chemical �transmitter� produced at nerve endings, which inhibits both nerve to nerve and nerve to muscle communication.

 the potential for development is enhanced by emergent resources in molecular biology and associated technologies, most notably dna microarrays consisting of transcriptionally relevant nucleic acid sequences that can be used to detect altered gene expression in cells, tissues and various life stages of organisms exposed to chemical and natural stressors.
 under an osha hazard communication standard, based on animal chronic toxicity studies of inorganic borate chemicals, boric acid and/or borates are hazardous materials.
 boric acid is a substance of chemical contained traces of arsenic,  which is known to the state of california to cause cancer.
 i do not wish to see the loss of boric acid and/or borates as we have seen in the past the loss of so many other fine pesticides, due to improper methods of application, which in many cases unnecessarily exposed people to hazardous chemicals.
 vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.
 in the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.
 syed sattar and coworkers who have developed a two-tier quantitative carrier test to assess sporicidal, mycobactericidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and protozoacidal activity of chemical germicides 701, 803.
 caution against entering a field sprayed with sulphuric acidmany of the chemicals used in pesticides are persistent soil contaminants, whose impact may endure for decades and adversely affect soil conservation.[19] conservation.[19]
 we carry a wide range of both chemical and biological acaracides.
 2,4,5-tchemically, agent orange is an approximately 1:1 mixture of two phenoxyl herbicides � 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-t) � in iso-octyl ester form.[12] form.[12]
 scientists have long understood that spraying crops with jasmonic acid - a chemical naturally produced by plant leaves when attacked by insects - reduces pest attack.
acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released into the air.
